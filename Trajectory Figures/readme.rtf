\f0\fs24 \cf0 Step1\
Run R file named \'93c-score\'94 to get the 2 groups of outcome of interest for cfDNA. (EP and LTS)\
\
Step2\
Run R file named \'93f-score\'94 to get the 2 groups of outcome of interest for FLRatio. (EP and LTS)\
\
Step3\
Run R file named \'93all in one plot\'94 to get the trajectory plot for 4 groups.\
